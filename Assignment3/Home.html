		<h2 class="color2">Why is cyber security important?</h2>
		<p class="color2">Cyber security is important because it encompasses everything that relates to protecting our data from cyber attackers who want to steal this information and use it to cause harm. 
		This can be sensitive data, governmental and industry information, personal information, personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, and protected health information (PHI). <br></br>
		Having advanced cyber defence programs and mechanisms in place to protect this data is crucial and in everyone’s interest. Everyone in society relies on critical infrastructure
		such as hospitals and other healthcare institutions, financial service programs, and power plants. We need these to keep our society running. At an individual level, cyber security attacks can lead to identity theft and extortion attempts, which can do serious damage to that individual’s life.</p>
		<ul class="color2">
		<li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Cybersecurity is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, and intellectual property. Data breaches can lead to devastating consequences, including identity theft and financial losses.</li>
		<li><strong>Privacy Preservation:</strong> Our online activities generate a vast amount of personal data. Cybersecurity measures help protect our privacy by preventing unauthorized access and data theft, ensuring that our personal information remains confidential.</li>
		<li><strong>Business Continuity:</strong> For organizations, maintaining cybersecurity is essential for business continuity. Cyberattacks can disrupt operations, leading to downtime, financial losses, and damage to reputation. Strong cybersecurity measures help ensure uninterrupted business operations.</li>
		<li><strong>Preventing Financial Losses:</strong> Cyberattacks can result in substantial financial losses. Businesses can face the cost of recovering from a breach, regulatory fines, and potential lawsuits. Individuals may incur expenses related to identity theft or fraud.</li>
		<li><strong>National Security:</strong> Cybersecurity is a matter of national security. Critical infrastructure, government agencies, and military operations rely on secure digital systems. Cyberattacks on these entities can have severe consequences for a nation's security and stability.</li>
		<li><strong>Intellectual Property Protection:</strong> Companies invest significant resources in research and development. Cybersecurity safeguards intellectual property from theft or espionage, ensuring that innovations remain proprietary.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="color2">In summary, cybersecurity is not just a matter of protecting data; it's about safeguarding our privacy, financial well-being, and national security. It's a collective responsibility that requires constant vigilance and investment to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.</p>
